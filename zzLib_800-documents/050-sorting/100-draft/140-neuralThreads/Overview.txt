Mesh threads are proven, flexibly gripping a volume of neural tissue at anchoring intersections, but could possible have minor theoretical issues scaling to high electrode site density.

*) Possible fragility. Thin wires in the mesh may have low tensie strength compared to the large volume of tissue displaced, dragged, etc.

*) Possible depanelization cost. Such thin wires may necessitate repeated photomachining to separate.

*) Possible fabrication area cost. Unless mesh threads are fabricated and expanded diagonally, empty space between the thin wires may be unused, but much smaller than the FOV of even a small prototyping maskless photolithography tool, wasting light and time.

*) Possible fabrication area overuse. Assuming a fabricated area diameter of 35um for threads, estimates show 'neuralBits_cm2' of ~98/100 at ~3Million ES. While doable, especially if additional slivers of threads are bonded to the bundles, this is a rare case of design approaching practical manufacturing and implementation limits, likely avoidable. Manufacturing might be much less complicated, and much more reliable, otherwise.

*) Possible collateral damage imposed limits to electrode site density. A 'threadGap_um' value of ~325um has been presumed reasonable, however, if the total volume displaced by any thread or needle could mostly be reduced to half of ~25um, ~4x higher electrode density might be tolerable, increasing total electrode site count much further above whatever minimum requirements may be relevant.
 *) SEVERE - Connecting stimulation points to a large fraction of neurons in vivo (eg. 100Million stimulation only ES at 1% or 1Billion stimulation only ES at 10%) could be necessary for some purposes (eg. exocortex). Mesh threads may require hollow needle diameters ~100um or worse, for which such density would impose prohibitive collateral damage.
  *) Reported multiunit recording equivalence would suggest a small number of ES relative to neuron count should suffice... nevertheless technology must be designed to best practical limits to best ensure usefulness.

_ NeuE probes _

Thin wiring, thick electrode bump, woven along neural tissue.

Much of the same benefit as mesh threads is very obvious. Wiring would be loose and bendable, decoupling mechanical stress, both as strain relief between thread/bundle, and complying with any cardiac/respiratory vibration between electrode sites. Thick electrode bumps combine the function of biocompatible mechanical anchor points with the electrode sites.

Biocompatibility mechanically benefitting from larger electrode sites, may reduce minor design risk from either electrode impedance or small volume high surface area structures (eg. nanowires, carbon nanotubes, etc) that otherwise could corrode (ie. dissolve away) or may necessitate additional resources (eg. nanowire semiconductors from added genetic material).
