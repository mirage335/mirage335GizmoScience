ATX PSU -> XT90*2 and Motherboard Power Extension
	(standard power connectors from soldered metal box)

120VAC -> Automatic Transfer Switch, Millisecond, Fast, Changeover Switch, 120V -> ATX PSU
120VAC -> LVDC -> CC CV Power Supply -> Battery/Disconnect -> Inverter -> Automatic Transfer Switch, Millisecond, Fast, Changeover Switch, 120V


Sustains idle or low power from (presuming adequate overload and overdischarge protection) relatively weak inverter and battery. Full CPU/GPU load while more than momentarily (ie. intentionally) disconnected from power is NOT normal.

	'Weight' '2.65'
		Presumably kg , converts to <6lbs . Relatively lightweight, at least for the power output.
