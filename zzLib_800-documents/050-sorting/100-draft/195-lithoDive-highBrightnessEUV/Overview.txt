Some evidence seems to suggest compact EUV light sources can achieve micrometer intensity beyond hundreds of milliwatts.

Cost of sufficiently high purity tin may be the deciding factor between tin and Xenon. Xenon is already reportedly scalable to tens of watts, apparently at micrometer intensity, already well beyond requirements for EUVL prototyping. However, the relevance of Xenon based sources is not conclusively established, and tin purity may be less of an issue for prototyping by two orders of magnitude.



_ Further _

IIRC, tin under YAG laser illumination was ruled out on some inadequate throughput basis, below EUVL prototyping requirements either before writing uTST, or in fact documented in uTST. Repetition rate may have been the issue. What was the reason for ruling out that technology, and is that reason relevant, for example, to CO2 laser and newer solid-state lasers?

If cost is sufficiently low, 'portability' may be achieved by simply building wherever needed. Particularly relevant to use of CO2 laser tubes, which may be bulky, but relatively lightweight and low cost.



_ Conclusions _

Heavy metal LPP (water window short wavelength), Xenon, and Tin, EUV (or BEUV Beyond Extreme UltraViolet) light sources must all be pursued.

Xenon has expected advantages with input laser simplicity and compactness, with acceptable power limits. Yet, Xenon may emit heavy ions, with a prohibitive effect on collector optics useful lifespan.

Tin may be necessary to avoid optics degradation, and tin droplets are produced with no surrounding particles and no deviation from an exact position certified by hours of high-speed camera photographs of identically placed pairs of tin droplets in a continuous stream.

Slide presentation as YouTube video from 'Cymer' channel is exceptionally informative, though nothing seen was unexpected except maybe the simplicity of the system. The CO2 laser focusing was stated as diffraction limited to a 100um spot size, implying a ~10:1 focal length to diameter ratio . There may be some scaling inefficiency from droplet sizes below the focal spot, but this should not be prohibitive, especially if the droplets are shaped into liquid sheets comparable to laser spot size.

Deciding factor may be tin purity. If such refinement techniques as zone melting of the tin are required, then the raw materials cost of Xenon may be irrelevant.

Modern debris collection in both cases (ie. Tin and Xenon) may rely on strong (ie. superconducting at large scale) magnets.


Useful lifespan of collector optics, unlike throughput, is still as much of a concern here, if not more of a concern. Much time may be invested in manufacturing a single device, so any variation or human intervention is a risk to any acceptable yield.



_ Findings _

Concave shape diameter may merely be of a similar magnitude as the focal spot diameter - confining the plasma to prevent thinning of the material. Hotter temperature from better confinement may directly improve spectral efficiency by reducing the occurrence of low temperature plasma due to temperature decrease typical of gas expansion or expansion outside the laser focal spot.


Same CO2 laser, with a (possibly beamsplitter or rotating mirror) beam redirect, is used for both prepulse (tin droplet melting, shaping to laser diameter, and carving of a line down the droplet) as well as for plasma producing (as the droplet travels horizontally towards the center of the mirror).

ASML's droplet generator is in fact tested to generate only droplets and at exact intervals over several hours.



Phosphor can be used after EUV bandpass mirrors to specifically detect EUV.


Xenon may be PROHIBITIVE due to high energy ions degrading collection optics. Yet the limit otherwise may be several tens of watts of EUV light.


Droplet position and velocity must be highly predictable, but not necessarily without some spin. Deliberate introduction of spin may influence droplet shape after melting.

Smaller optics and correspondingly smaller droplet path may reduce droplet speed. Stated droplet speeds are over a possibly wider range than ~80m/s to ~10m/s .

Some particles around tin droplet may be necessary. If solid matter is usable, tin wire with preformed impressions, coatings, etc, pushed through a small opening, essentially resembling a spark plug, may be simpler than tin droplets in free space.


MAJOR - Concave droplet shape is due to the tin droplet moving past the prepulse laser, as the focal spot of that laser is down the middle.

Such output power as the claimed 20W is quite high.
