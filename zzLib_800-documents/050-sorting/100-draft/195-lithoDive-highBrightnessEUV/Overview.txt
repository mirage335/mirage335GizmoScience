Some evidence seems to suggest compact EUV light sources can achieve micrometer intensity beyond hundreds of milliwatts.

Cost of sufficiently high purity tin may be the deciding factor between tin and Xenon. Xenon is already reportedly scalable to tens of watts, apparently at micrometer intensity, already well beyond requirements for EUVL prototyping. However, the relevance of Xenon based sources is not conclusively established.



_ Conclusions _

Both Xenon and Tin EUV light sources must be pursued.

Xenon has expected advantages with input laser simplicity and compactness, with acceptable power limits. Yet, Xenon may emit heavy ions, with a prohibitive effect on collector optics useful lifespan.

Tin may be necessary to avoid optics degradation, and such workarounds as tin wire instead of droplets, or control of the velocity (ie. spin) of the droplets, may simplify correct placement of the droplets at collector optics focus. Yet, tin droplets may require other surrounding particles, and tin plasmas may not be scalable.

Slide presentation as YouTube video from 'Cymer' channel is exceptionally informative, though nothing seen was unexpected except maybe the simplicity of the system. The CO2 laser focusing was stated as diffraction limited to a 100um spot size, implying a ~10:1 focal length to diameter ratio . There may be some scaling inefficiency from droplet sizes below the focal spot, but this should not be prohibitive, especially if the droplets are shaped into liquid sheets comparable to laser spot size.

Deciding factor may be tin purity. If such refinement techniques as zone melting of the tin are required, then the raw materials cost of Xenon may be irrelevant.

Modern debris collection in both cases (ie. Tin and Xenon) may rely on strong (ie. superconducting at large scale) magnets.


Useful lifespan of collector optics, unlike throughput, is still as much of a concern here, if not more of a concern. Much time may be invested in manufacturing a single device, so any variation or human intervention is a risk to any acceptable yield.



_ Findings _

Phosphor can be used after EUV bandpass mirrors to specifically detect EUV.


Xenon may be PROHIBITIVE due to high energy ions degrading collection optics. Yet the limit otherwise may be several tens of watts of EUV light.


Droplet position and velocity must be highly predictable, but not necessarily without some spin. Deliberate introduction of spin may influence droplet shape after melting.

Smaller optics and correspondingly smaller droplet path may reduce droplet speed. Stated droplet speeds are over a possibly wider range than ~80m/s to ~10m/s .

Some particles around tin droplet may be necessary. If solid matter is usable, tin wire with preformed impressions, coatings, etc, pushed through a small opening, essentially resembling a spark plug, may be simpler than tin droplets in free space.


MAJOR - Concave droplet shape is due to the tin droplet moving past the prepulse laser, as the focal spot of that laser is down the middle.

		Seems the intensity may be mostly within expected 1umSq field of view.
			SEVERE - If indeed the intensity is as desired for small field-of-view, possibly due to better intensity by avoiding long wavelength CO2 lasers (IIRC this has been seen reported by academic literature of desktop EUV light sources using pulsed YAG lasers), then tin droplet method may not be worthwhile. Such output power as the claimed 20W is quite high.
				SEVERE SEVERE - Whether the spectral intensity of a Xenon source is adequate without a concave shape is not obvious. Xenon is very expensive, and if not reused, may be prohibitive. Thus, favoring tin droplets as a possibly reasonable cost saving measure.

	'The resulting hot helium atoms must be cooled in order to sustain the ability to produce a population inversion in the carbon dioxide molecules. In sealed lasers, this takes place as the helium atoms strike the walls of the laser discharge tube. In flow-through lasers, a continuous stream of CO2 and nitrogen is excited by the plasma discharge and the hot gas mixture is exhausted from the resonator by pumps.'
	'The addition of helium also plays a role in the initial vibrational excitation of N2, due to a near-resonant dissociation reaction with metastable He(23S1). Substituting helium with other noble gases, such as neon or argon, does not lead to an enhancement of laser output.'
