Laboratory EUVL has existed from the 'mid-1980s'. All that 'lithoDive' adds is modern automation.

Specifically, 'lithoDive' will only add motion control (eg. air bearings, actinic imaging during exposure, scatterometry, etc), maskless (eg. DLP) modulation, real-time defect correction, an automated workflow for processing only a small part of a single chip at a time, and possibly some somewhat more cost-effective adaptive optics.

Since this is nothing new, prior research exists. Where the more distributed economics of prototyping are relevant, rather than the concentrated throughput economics of factories, much less sophisticated techniques and different materials can be suitable for light sources, mirrors, and photo resist.

Because much of this research has been around quite a while, and because such specifics as numeric sensitivity figures, chemical formulas, etc, are needed, ChatGPT may be able to identify the literature documenting best known techniques and materials.

	SEVERE - This may be the best information so far on maskless EUVL, especially with an emphasis on optics that can take advantage of maskless, and with only 100x (ie. two orders of magnitude) less throughput.

	'It will be shown nanomirrors based maskless approach is one path to costeffective and defect-free EUV lithography, rather than making it even more complicated.'
		SEVERE - Strongly implies shutters are less desirable than the 'DLP' kind of approach. Whether the resulting optics proposed can otherwise achieve similar throughput or numerical aperture easily, may be dubious.
	'The focus of our work is to optimize the existing vertical comb process and scale down the mirror size from several microns to sub-micron regime.'
	'The wafer scan and EUV laser jitter induced image blur phenomenon is discussed and a blurred imaging theory is constructed. This blur effect is found to degrade the image contrast at a level that mainly depends on the wafer scan speed.'
