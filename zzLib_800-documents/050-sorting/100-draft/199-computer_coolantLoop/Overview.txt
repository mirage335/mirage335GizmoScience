Cryogenic cooling can improve single-thread (ie. CPU single-core) and single-device (ie. off-the-shelf single GPU) performance by ~50%. As transistor speed improvements inevitably ends completely due to scanning probe and electron scattering manufacturing feasibility limits or (unrealistically) single-atom physical limits, cryogenic cooling *WILL* be the ONLY widely available means of getting fast computers. In all probability, widely available cooling will switch from air, to water, to LN2, while avoiding LHE, as air cooling has already become a significant fraction of high-performance chip costs, and the cost difference of LN2 is not much higher.

Cryogenic computer cooling is now an inevitable next step, with the usual incentives for early adopters.

Compatibility with cryogenic cooling should not be difficult. Water vapor must be excluded, and copper (ie. embrittlement) is already the preferred coolant loop material.


_ Conclusions _

Chilling a transfer fluid (eg. methanol, refined diethyl ether starter fluid, etc) other than LN2, with LN2, is either preferable or at least an appropriate intermediate technology.

Fittings and pump must be compatible with LN2 temperatures.

Fittings height must be *strictly* limited to keep computer thin.




_ DUBIOUS _

Proprietary software configuration breakage (eg. display configuration) and proprietary software licensing are the most significant reasons keep hardware the same, switching coolant, instead of switching the disk (electrically or physically). Dubious. Only some specialized use cases (eg. simulation, CAD modeling, gaming, etc) have such issues.

That said, in the absence of such machines being common place, for a single person, the capital expenditure can be less with such portability and adaptability.


_ Expectations _

Switch to LN2 from room-temperature coolant
1) Idle or suspended thermal load. Chassis gas must minimize frost and differential thermal expansion stress - dry, thermally conductive, noncorrosive (ie. helium), and cold (<15degC).
2) Chilled compressed gas <<-75degC purge room-temperature liquid coolant.
3) Switch solenoids/valves to LN2.
4) Pump LN2 increasingly until boiling rate is regular.
5) Allow full thermal load.

Low-temperature (ie. ~-196degC) coolant liquid (eg. organic or silicone fluids?) would be preferred to avoid either of several possible alternatives:
*) Differential thermal expansion stress from switching quickly to much colder coolant (particularly for ~15W idle powered systems).
*) Software complexities of reliable automatic suspend/resume/etc .
*) Hardware complexities of valving from cryogenic gas to boiling cryogenic liquid.
*) Helium or hydrogen gas cooling (pressurized through water cooling blocks due to thermal conductivity) to below LN2 boiling temperature.

If cost is less than person-hours using the computer, and if electronics can endure a reasonable few years, then LN2, hydrogen gas, or other cryogenic coolant, from a central source, may be used continuously instead.


Corrosive liquid coolants (eg. methanol) may necessitate inspection not possible with pure copper heatsinks (ie. acrylic forbidden). An unused heatsink with minimal flow may be placed on the non-cryogenic side as an indicator of relevant failures, or such failure may simply be inferred from degraded cooling.






_ Conclusions _


*) Embrittlement of most materials may be avoided entirely by keeping temperatures slightly above LN2. Reportedly, such materials as 'Buna-N', 'Silicone', 'Viton', 'ABS', 'Acetal', 'Delrin', etc, have embrittlement temperatures of -184degC, -168degC, etc, only slightly above LN2.

		MAJOR - CPU and GPU cooling must be separate. Might as well separate chassis cooling. More extensive than the sketch presented for 'cryogenic computer', but not unpredictable or unexpected.
		MAJOR - Anticipatory 'PID' cooling. Instead of sensing power physically, modern CPUs and GPUs should have sufficient software readouts to instrument this accurately, if necessary.

	No pump. Pressurization of LN2 tank forces liquid into a tube presumably open at bottom inside tank. Relief valves control pressurization mechanically. Solenoid valves control flow of LN2. Second tank (relatively unpressurized) recovers remaining LN2 liquid.
		Loop could be closed by recovering N2 gas from relief valves, and periodically raising a recovery tank by winch to dump that LN2 liquid back to source.
