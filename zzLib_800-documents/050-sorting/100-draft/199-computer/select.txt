_ Conclusions _


*) Embrittlement of most materials may be avoided entirely by keeping temperatures slightly above LN2. Reportedly, such materials as 'Buna-N', 'Silicone', 'Viton', 'ABS', 'Acetal', 'Delrin', etc, have embrittlement temperatures of -184degC, -168degC, etc, only slightly above LN2.

O-Ring compression fittings may be temporarily acceptable until flare fittings can be proven. Silicone o-rings may be retrofitted.

Flare fittings should be avoidable if temperatures are kept slightly above LN2.

	Coolant liquids. Methanol may be useful in either a 30%methanol/70%water or 50%/50% mixture to improve flow and reduce viscosity, but has severe disadvantages (eg. much greater corrosion potential, possible additive incompatibility) and would worsen cooling performance at higher concentration (ie. due to lower heat capacity).

	Albeit, ethanol should be slightly less efficient than methanol.


https://www.overclock.net/threads/qvl-thermal-compound-no-conductonaut.1644882/
	So conductonaut (ie. liquid metal thermal paste) may be allowable, not expected to cause severe damage, however, if not necessary, possibly undesirable and high-risk.

	Hardening of thermal paste at tip of dispenser is definitely possible.
