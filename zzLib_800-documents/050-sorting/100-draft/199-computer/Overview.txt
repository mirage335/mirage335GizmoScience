*) At least, 96GB RAM, strongly prefer 128GB RAM for VR workstation - combination VR (>>32GB), browser (32GB), virtualization (<12GB, PanelVM), other VMs suspended).
 *) TeamViewer and such may obviate 2*12GB VMs .
 *) Abnormal builds (eg. Gentoo) would require <~32GB/8thread .


*) MAJOR - Maximum RAM clock is VERY substantially necessary.


*) IPKVM should be compatible with at least some smartphones having HDMI out and USB input. Failing that, simple robotics and camera should suffice.

*) Amateur radio handie-talke through RasPi or similar should suffice for uploaded or VR full-dive users to call for help if necessary... a radio direction findable distress beacon is one of the very few uses if not the only use for amateur radio. Microphone level activation is simplest.



*) SEVERE - SATA chipset can cause severe kernel latency (~15s)... such 'motherboard' hardware peripherials must be avoided carefully.



*) Upgrade or hardware reconfiguration (especially disabling memory modules) may be necessary. Any solder sealing a metal chassis must be removable.

*) Liquid cooling must also cool RAM, there is significant evidence of clock rate performance benefit.
